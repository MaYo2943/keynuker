== Github Monitoring

=== User posts content to personal repo

It's not enough to just monitor a github org.  Users may post to their own repos outside the org.

=== User posts content to private personal repo, makes public 

If a user posts content to a private repo, and then makes it public, the entire repo will need to be scanned.

=== User posts content too large to be sent via webhook

According to github webhooks doc, if payload > 5MB, the webhook will be skipped.

=== User posts a gist with aws keys 

Normal user events API don't include gists!!  Need to track these separately

=== User posts a ton of changes all at once

This might cause the polling loop to exceed rate limit
